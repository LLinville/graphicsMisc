Store as textures:
Velocity
    - (float, float, null, null)
    Needs buffer VelA, VelB since it is updated based on its current value for advection

Pressure
    - (float, null, null, null)

Temperature

Pressure gradient?





How to get cooling as spreading? Divergence?




Reaction
    Transmute
        - Calculate how much to transmute
        - Add potential lost as heat



Movement
    Percolate per-substance by partial density
        - Add potential lost as heat
    Calculate divergence of velocity
    Update temperature by divergence (
        * Is this redundant with pressure change?
    Calculate gradient of pressure
    Update velocities by gradient of pressure
    Update velocities by gradient of gravitational potential
    Advect
        - Advect pressure
        - Advect velocity
        - Advect temperature
    Diffuse velocity
        - Convert difference from pre-diffusion velocity to heat
            - Use equivalent in-place laplacian?
        - Convert shear to heat
